The boy was there when the sun rose. A rod is used
The catch pink salmon. The thoughts of the huge river is the clear spring
Take the ball straight and follow through
When they get back to her feet a part of tea helped to pass the evening
Smokey fires like flame and heat
Top cushion broke the man's ball the salt breed came across from the sea
The girl at the booth sold 50 bonds
